# CSC8503 Advanced Game Technologies

My coursework for the Advanced Game Technologies module at Newcastle University.

## Included Scripts

`test-server.sh` and `test-server.bat` are included to launch a server and a
client in one click on Linux and Windows respectively. The Linux version
requires `tmux` to be installed and is more capable, building the project before
launching.
